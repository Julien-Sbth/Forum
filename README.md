This project had already been started before but I decided to start from scratch.

Previous versions did not meet my expectations, hence this new approach.

To use this code, follow these steps:

## 1. Download SQlite

##  Click [Here](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) for download SQlite

For the moment I choose SQlite but in the future I change to a another database (postgreSQL, MySQL)

## 2 You also need Docker to build the project in the dockerFile

In this project, you can post anything you can (messages, donâ€™t like the pictures at the moment but it will come with the future),

I use several import like gorrilla session, crypto wbesocket securecookie.

The Gorrilla session can make a session for the user and it facilitates the task for it, the encryption of the password in the database and is more protected if the database is bypassed, websocket is to talk between users, securecookie is for a token if the user forgets their password.
