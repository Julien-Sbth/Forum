##### Work in Progress

##### This project was previously initiated, but I've chosen to start a new.

##### To utilize this code, follow these steps:

## 1. Download SQLite 
Click [Here](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) for download SQlite

##### It's necessary for using SQLite in the project.

## 2. Download TDM-GCC

##### Click [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/) to download TDM-GCC.

##### TDM-GCC allows you to compile SQLITE

##### I'm using TDM-GCC because it can compile SQLITE3 code effectively.

##### Currently, I've opted for SQLite, but I might switch to a different database (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) in the future.

# Within this project

 you can create various postsâ€”messages are supported, while picture functionality is pending but planned for the future (works soon) but you can see in the code you can upload Images but they are displayed in the first row, (I am in the process of correcting this).

## 

## I'm employing several imports like Gorilla session, Crypto WebSocket, and SecureCookie.

The Gorilla session establishes a user session, easing their interaction. The password encryption in the database enhances security against bypass attempts. WebSocket facilitates communication between users, and SecureCookie generates a token for users who forget their passwords.
